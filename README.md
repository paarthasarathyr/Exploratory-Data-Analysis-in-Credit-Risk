Strategic Insights for Informed Credit Lending: A Comprehensive Analysis of Defaulter Credit Risk

In this project, I conducted a thorough analysis of credit risk among potential defaulters, aiming to provide valuable insights for strategic decision-making in credit lending. 
The analysis involved a detailed examination of various financial and demographic factors contributing to credit risk. 
By employing robust data analysis techniques, I identified patterns, trends, and key indicators associated with individuals at risk of default.


The developed insights offer a nuanced understanding of the credit risk landscape, enabling the formulation of targeted strategies to mitigate potential losses. 
The recommendations provided are strategically aligned to guide the bank in making informed decisions regarding credit lending to specific target groups.
The overarching goal is to enhance the overall risk management framework and optimize lending practices, ensuring a more secure and profitable credit portfolio for the institution.
